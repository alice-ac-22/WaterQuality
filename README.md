This project focuses on predicting and analyzing surface water quality using machine learning techniques.
It utilizes publicly available datasets containing long-term records of water quality parameters, merged, cleaned, and analyzed to assess trends and build predictive models for water quality (CCME values).

**Dataset**

Since the dataset is larger than 25 MB, it can be downloaded from:

A Comprehensive Surface Water Quality Monitoring Dataset (1940–2023) – Figshare (https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/A_Comprehensive_Surface_Water_Quality_Monitoring_Dataset_1940-2023_2_82Million_Record_Resource_for_Empirical_and_ML-Based_Research/27800394)

After downloading, place the CSV file (e.g., combined.csv) in the root project directory.



**Setup Instructions**

*1. Clone the repository*

git clone https://github.com/alice-ac-22/WaterQuality.git

cd WaterQuality


*2. Install dependencies*


*3. Get the dataset*
Download the dataset using the link above and place it in the main project folder (combined.csv).

*4. Run the project*
