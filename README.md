# WaterQuality ML Project

**Machine Learning models for predicting and analyzing global surface water quality (1940â€“2023)**  
This project uses the open-access dataset by *Karim et al. (2025)* to predict the **Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) Values** and explore further pollutant interrelationships.

## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps to run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**
   Open your terminal (or VS Code) and run:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/alice-ac-22/WaterQuality.git
   cd WaterQuality
  
  
2. **Download the dataset**

Since the dataset is larger than 25 MB, it can be found publicly and downloaded through the following link:
