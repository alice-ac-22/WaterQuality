# WaterQuality ML Project

**Machine Learning models for predicting and analyzing global surface water quality (1940â€“2023)**  
This project uses the open-access dataset by *Karim et al. (2025)* to predict the **Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) Values** and explore further pollutant interrelationships.

## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps to run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**
   Open your terminal (or VS Code) and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/WaterQuality.git
   cd WaterQuality

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

   python -m venv venv
   
   *Activate the environment*
  
   source venv/bin/activate      # For Mac/Linux

   venv\Scripts\activate         # For Windows

3. **Install the dependencies**

Python required, then run:
pip install -r requirements.txt


4. **Download the dataset**

Since the dataset is larger than 25 MB, it can be found publicly and downloaded through the following link:
