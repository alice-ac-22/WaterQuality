# WaterQuality ML Project

**Machine Learning models for predicting and analyzing global surface water quality (1940‚Äì2023)**  
This project uses the open-access dataset by *Karim et al. (2025)* to predict the **Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index (CCME WQI)** and explore further pollutant interrelationships.
